Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized digital currency (cryptocurrency), launched on January 9, 2009. It was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous author of the Bitcoin [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). It allowed people to make peer-to-peer transactions over the internet without intermediaries for the first time.
The creation of Bitcoin was possible thanks to the implementation of blockchain. A technology that allows Bitcoin to be a decentralized digital currency.

Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, meaning that its value can change drastically in a short period of time.

Even though Bitcoin has been the most popular cryptocurrency since its inception, it is far less useful compared to Ethereum because it does not have smart contracts. You can buy `$BTC` for a few reasons:

1. To own "digital gold"
2. To prevent your wealth from losing value due to inflation
3. To diversify your portfolio
4. To trade Bitcoin (Buy low, sell high)

## Why does it have value?

Bitcoin is another form of currency. A currency has value because people agree on its value. You can't use monopoly money to buy lunch because people see it as worthless. There are many other factors that affect the price of a currency, but it all comes down to people. Bitcoin has value because people want it and use it, like any other currency.

## Why should I care? How does it affect me?

You now have the option of truly owning your wealth. When you deposit your money in a bank, you are putting your trust on this bank. You agree that they can do whatever they wish with you money, as long as you can withdraw it at any time.

If due to some catastrophic event this bank becomes insolvent, it is up to the government wether you get your money back or not. You don't need to know exactly how a bank works, just know that it's totally possible for your bank to fail become unable to give you your money back. Banks can fail and have failed many times!

## Inflation

When a government prints money, your money loses buying power. This is called inflation. You may not notice this effect because it can take years to become evident.

Bitcoin has a limited supply 21 million Bitcoin, which makes its value go up due to the law of supply and demand. Every day more people want Bitcoin, while Bitcoin because becomes scarcer.

Nobody can "print" bitcoin.

## Bitcoin Halving

Every time 210,000 Bitcoin blocks are mined, an event occurs on the blockchain that reduces the amount of Bitcoin that miners receive as a reward by half. This occurs approximately every four years because Bitcoin blocks are mined every 10 minutes.
