Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform and it is used to pay for the network fees.

A smart contract is a self-executing piece of code. It removes the need for intermediaries like banks. The trust needed to transact money comes from the fact that smart contract cannot be modified. The only potential for unexpected outcomes comes from human error (bugs) when creating the logic for a smart contract. Smart contracts are the reason why Ethereum is the most actively used blockchain.

The Ethereum developers have created financial tools that make up the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It is a decentralized, permissionless, transparent and censorship-resistant alternative to the current financial system.

This is still a relatively new technology for more than just peer-to-peer payments. Ethereum already has lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, derivatives trading and more.

## Gas Fees

Gas is a price in ETH that must be paid in order to have your transaction be executed by the Ethereum network.

Gas is a problematic topic in the Ethereum network. When a lot of people are trying to use the Ethereum blockchain at once, it becomes extremely expensive to perform transactions.

The Ethereum foundation is currently working to fix this issue by upgrading the Ethereum mainnet to Ethereum 2.0. An improved version of the Ethereum blockchain that aims to fix this scalability issue, making transactions much cheaper.

You can check live gas fees at [gasnow.org](https://www.gasnow.org).

## How to receive ETH

When you create a crypto wallet with MetaMask, it automatically creates an account for you. This account contains an Ethereum Address. You can create as many accounts as you need in MetaMask using the menu in the top right corner and clicking on **Create Account**

Ethereum addresses look like this:

```
0x358a6c0f7614c44b344381b0699e2397b1483252
```

This is all you need to receive ETH.

You could have a "Investing" account and "Trading" account. It is good to separate concerns.

## How to send Ether (ETH)

You may send ETH from a centralized exchange to your account on MetaMask. Centralized exchanges let you buy cryptocurrencies using your bank account. These entities are needed because we are still transitioning from centralized finance to decentralized finance. Coinbase is popular example and you could use it as a bridge between your bank account and you Crypto wallet.

It's important to double check every time you paste ethereum addresses. Check the first and last four characters, make sure they are correct. You should avoid typing it yourself at all costs. Depending on what device you're using you may be able to scan the QR code corresponding to the Ethereum Address. This is a more convenient method.

These checks are important because transactions CANNOT be reversed. They may be canceled, but only if you do so before the transaction is confirmed. If you send crypto to the wrong address you will lose your funds.

Note that all transactions in Ethereum requires a gas fee. This fee fluctuates depending on the volume of transactions. If there are many people trying to transact, it will cost you more. This is a small amount of ETH that will be paid to those who keep the blockchain running. You should always have ETH in your accounts.
