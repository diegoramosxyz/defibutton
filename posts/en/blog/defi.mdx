Decentralized Finance is a new, open and global financial system. It is an alternative to the old, closed and restricted financial system. With just an internet connection you get absolute control over your money and access to a censorship-resistant global market that never closes. DeFi is currently a multi-billion dollar market.

DeFi is a collection of smart contracts available in a blockchain, like a Ethereum. For this reason, DeFi has no owner, no government, no president, no CEO. Smart contracts are computer code that specify how a financial service works. They automate the job that humans would do at a bank or any other financial institution.

The current financial system is centralized. You must rely on intermediaries who control your money. This is not ideal because you have to trust other humans. The only thing you need to trust in decentralized finance is open source code.

## Decentralized Finance vs. Centralized Finance

The transition to decentralized finance is about automating finance, removing all intermediaries and creating a global financial system available to everyone.

Here is a table comparing the two financial systems:

| DeFi                                                               | CeFi                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You hold your money.                                               | Others hold your money for you.                                |
| All you need to use it is an internet connection.                  | You need to qualify to use it.                                 |
| Everything is open source. There are no secrets.                   | It has secrets.                                                |
| It cannot be censored because it is decentralized. No one owns it. | It can be censored or restricted.                              |
| Transactions are cheaper.                                          | It is costly to pay for personel.                              |
| The markets never close.                                           | It has a work schedule because it is run by humans.            |
| It can be private                                                  | Your personal data and other data is collected and stored.     |
| Transactions can happen in minutes or even seconds.                | Transactions can take days to complete due to human involment. |

It is up to you now. Decide whether you want to stick with the current financial system or you want to take control over your money.
