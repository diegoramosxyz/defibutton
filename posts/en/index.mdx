The main objective of this page is to serve as a guide to people with little or no experience in the world of crypto and/or decentralized finance to minimize risks as much as possible.

Over the years, even highly experienced people tend to make mistakes, take unnecessary risks, and/or stagnate at times where instructions are not clear to new users.

Defi Button accelerates the learning curve for all those who have a desire to learn and commit to invest the necessary time in this learning.

## The current state of decentralized finance

You probably have a bank account. Although it works, it is not ideal because the bank has authority over your money. Ideally, you would have the same power over your cash, as your savings and all your digital money.

But there is someone who has power over your cash. The government controls the currency you use.

Cryptocurrencies solve these problems using methods like limited supply and decentralization.

If we had to put all the technologies around cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance into a sentence, it would be:

> I am the bank!

Nobody can freeze your funds, the government can't "print" cryptocurrencies, you can trade with anyone in the world without asking anyone for permission, there are no transfer limits and you can't be denied any DeFi service.
