AAVE is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol. Users can deposit funds to become liquidity providers and earn interest or borrow funds and pay interest.

## Lending

Lending in AAVE is straightforward. You can deposit an asset and earn interest. In other words, you are getting rewarded for providing liquidity.

## Borrowing

There are overcollateralized and under-collateralized loans in AAVE. Undercollateralized loans, or flash loans are an advanced topic intended for developers.

### Overcollateralized loans

Overcollateralized loans require you to deposit more than you borrow. This may sound strange if you have taken loans in traditional finance. Banks can provide uncollateralized loans, meaning the bank lends you money without you making a deposit. This is possible because a bank can take legal action against you if donâ€™t pay back with interest. A DeFi protocol does not have this power.

## What is the point of borrowing in AAVE if I have to deposit more than I borrow?

AAVE's overcollateralized loans can be used to cover unexpected expenses in a different cryptocurrency or to gain exposure to another asset while preserving all your collateral. The latter effectively becomes a form of leverage.

## Money Markets Protocols

The [Compound](/projects/compound) and AAVE protocols can be used for the same purpose, but they offer different interest rates. The interest rates in these protocols is dictated only by mathematical calculations. You may switch between them to obtain the highest return.
