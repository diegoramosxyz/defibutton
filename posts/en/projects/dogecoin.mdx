Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency based on the Litecoin blockchain created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in December, 2013. The name Dogecoin comes from the _Doge_ meme which was also used to create the logo of the cryptocurrency. 

This joke token gained insane popularity in 2021, partially because Elon Musk, who is known for his affinity for memes, continuosly expressed his support for this coin.

Despite beign a _joke_, in decentralized finance everyone has absolute control over their money. Just as people can wake up one day and decide to use Monopoly money as a medium of exchange, people could theoretically use Dogecoin the same way US dollars are used.
