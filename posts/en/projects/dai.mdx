DAI is a decentralized stablecoin soft-pegged to the US Dollar. It brings the best features of stable FIAT currencies to decentralized finance. DAI protects your wealth from volatility and it can be used as a medium of exchange, much like cash money.

All the $DAI in circulation is backed by an excess of collateral which comes in the form of various cryptocurrencies. DAI is generated through an over-collateralized borrowing mechanism provided by the Maker Protocol.

## Decentralized exchanges

You can also get $DAI from decentralized exchanges such as [Uniswap](/projects/uniswap).

## Inherent risk

The US Federal Reserve has a monopoly over the US Dollar and uses such power to control the monetary policies of the United States. If such monetary policies were to cause hyperinflation, the value of the US Dollar could drop significantly over a short period of time. This is scenario has repeated itself throughout history and causes currencies to become worthless. Although DAI is a decentralized stablecoin, it is still subject to US monetary policies. $DAI is stable **only if** the US Dollar is stable.
