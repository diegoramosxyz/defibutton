MetaMask is a crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain apps. It is a tool that let's you interact with Ethereum blockchains. You can buy, sell and swap cryptocurrencies with it.

## How to create an Ethereum wallet using MetaMask?

<Callout>
  Remember, the responsibility to keep your cryptocurrencies safe is YOURS and
  no one else's. If you ignore any step in this tutorial, you can lose all your
  money.

## Step 1

In your computer, click on this link https://metamask.io/ to go to the official MetaMask website and install the MetaMask extension that goes with your browser. You can also type `metamask.io` in
your address bar to get to the website. This is true for all websites, you can skip
typing `https://` because the browser will automatically add it.

<Callout>
  Get in the habit of typing links in your browser's address bar, instead of
  using a search engine like Google. You may end up in the wrong website, which
  is the worst possible outcome.

## Step 2

Press **Get started** > **Create a wallet**

MetaMask will ask you if you want to share usage metrics with them, you can press: **No Thanks**. It's up to you.

Create a password. This password must be unique, like all your passwords!

Now, grab a pencil and paper because this is the most important step, **saving your security phrase**. This is also called **mnemonics** or **seed phrase**. No one should ever see this, make sure there is no one behind you or security cameras!

## Step 3

Click on _"CLICK HERE TO REVEAL SECRET WORDS"_ and type all the words exactly as MetaMask shows.

The order of the words DOES matter, so write it down on a piece of paper like this:

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| 1. word | 7. word  |
| 2. word | 8. word  |
| 3. word | 9. word  |
| 4. word | 10. word |
| 5. word | 11. word |
| 6. word | 12. word |

In the next step, MetaMask will ask you to type these words to make sure you didn't make a mistake writing these words down.

Once you have completed this step, keep these words in a safe or any other secure location. You can also divide the words into two or three pieces of paper to reduce the chances that they will fall into the wrong hands. You can tell someone you **absolutely trust** where the phrase is in case something happens to you or you are unable to retrieve it. That person will be your last resort.

Remember that these words have the power to "summon" all your funds from anywhere. You can download the app on your smartphone, iOS or Android, from the official MetaMask website https://metamask.io/. With the application you can sync your computer and smartphone to access your funds on the go, but having a lot of money in a mobile crypto wallet is not recommended. These should be treated as cash wallets.

The password is only to secure your wallet in the computer. You can recover your wallet on any other computer with the phrase and create a new password. Again, the phrase is the most important thing!

Once this is completed, MetaMask will have created an Ethereum Wallet and an Ethereum Account for you to start exploring DeFi. Each Ethereum account contains an Ethereum Address, used to make transactions. You can have as many Ethereum accounts as you want within MetaMask.

## Step 4

Click on Account 1 at the top of MetaMask

MetaMask will copy the Ethereum Address corresponding to Account 1 (You can change this name) so that you can paste it using `Ctrl + v` (Windows) `Cmd + v` (Mac).

An Ethereum address looks like this:

```
0x2c83Df4D166477dd548a55290A10D3037D483Df8
```

Congrats! Now you can send or receive funds on the Ethereum blockchain ðŸŽ‰!
