The MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization constituted by all Maker ($MKR) holders which governs the **Maker Protocol**. The Maker Protocol provides tools for the creation of $DAI, a **decentralized stablecoin** that is not issued or administered by centralized actors or intermediaries. This stablecoin is soft-pegged to the US Dollar and it is a way for people to protect their wealth against volatility.

Dai is generated is by depositing cryptocurrency as collateral into a Maker Vault and borrowing $DAI against it. These vaults are smart contracts provided by the Maker Protocol which allow you to borrow a fraction of the value of your collateral. In other words, you let the smart contract hold your cryptocurrency in exchange for a $DAI loan. Once you pay back the loan in $DAI, the smart contract will return your cryptocurrency.

This borrowing mechanism ensures that all $DAI in circulation is backed by an excess of collateral.

The $MKR holders vote to decide which cryptocurrencies can be used as collateral to generate $DAI, as well as, the Dai Savings Rate and other technical aspects to ensure the safety and integrity of the Maker Protocol.
