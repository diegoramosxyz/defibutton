Compound is a protocol on Ethereum for the creation of money markets which allow for permissionless and trustless borrowing and lending with no intermediaries. 

Unlike traditional finance, users do not interact with other people to negotiate and perform transactions. Instead, they interact directly with the protocol, through a dApp, to either deposit their assets and **earn** interest, or to borrow assets and **pay** interest.

Interest rates are algorithmically set based on supply and demand.

## Lending 

To become a lender the user needs to deposit a supported asset into the protocol. The user will receive cTokens, which represent the amount that was deposited automatically accrue interest. Such tokens can be thought of as a _"receipt"_ from the protocol and they are used to claim the deposit, plus interest.

Lenders are also known as liquidity providers and they are incentiviced by the interest they earn.

## Borrowing

On the other hand, borrowing is a little different from traditional finance. In order to borrow an asset a user must first deposit a collateral, any other supported asset, with a value greater than the amount borrowed. This are called overcollateralized loans.

## What is the point of borrowing in Compound if I have to deposit more than I borrow?

Compound's overcollateralized loans can be used to cover unexpected expenses in a different cryptocurrency or to gain exposure to another asset while preserving all your collateral. The latter effectively becomes a form of leverage.

## Money Markets Protocols

The Compound and [AAVE](/projects/aave) protocols can be used for the same purpose, but they offer different interest rates. The interest rates in these protocols is dictated only by mathematical calculations. You may switch between them to obtain the highest return.
