Your money can be put to work and generate an income for you. This requires you to learn about the risks and intricacies of finance, protocols and free markets. Rari Capital aims to simplify the process of earning from capital with a robo-advisor which autonomously maximizes yield for you.

## What is $RGT?

The $RGT is the Rari Governance Token. It can be used to propose and vote proposals made by any token-holding community members. Every aspect of Rari Capital is managed using this voting mechanism, including the Rari Treasury.

## Rari Pools

To use the Rari protocol, you first deposit capital into one of Rari's pools. You will then become a token holder for the selected pool and the Rari protocol will immediately start maximizing your returns. The protocol optimizes for yield by lending and farming across multiple DeFi protocols, including, Compound, dYdX, KeeperDAO, mStable, yEarn, and Aave.

The alternative to this is going to each one of these DeFi platforms, using their interfaces to provide liquidity and and keep track of each investment to decide wether to reduce or increase your deposit. 

## Fees

Using the Rari protocol is not free. These are the fee rates for the Rari pools: 

- Stable Pool: 17.5% profits
- Yield Pool: 12.5% profits + 0.5% withdrawal
- ETH Pool: 17.5% of profits

However, Rari Capital is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), so the money won't be going to raise the salary of a CEO, instead 50% of the profits are used to buyback and burn $RGT and the other 50% is used for charity, through the Rari Foundation. And it's the $RGT holders who decide what charity to donate to. 

## Rari Foundation

The Rari Foundation is a donor-advised fund (DAF) managed by all $RGT holders. In other words, it is foundation which donates to the charity that the Rari Capital users choose.
