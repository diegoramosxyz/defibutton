Your money can be put to work and generate an income for you. This requires you to learn about the risks and intricacies of finance, protocols and free markets. Rari Capital aims to simplify the process of earning from capital with a robo-advisor which autonomously maximizes yield for you.

## How does it work?

You first deposit capital into one of Rari's pools. You will then become a token holder for the selected pool and the Rari protocol will immediately start maximizing your returns. The protocol optimizes for yield by lending and farming across multiple DeFi protocols, including, Compound, dYdX, KeeperDAO, mStable, yEarn, and Aave.

The alternative to this is going to each one of these DeFi platforms, using their interfaces to provide liquidity and and keep track of each investment to decide wether to reduce or increase your deposit.
