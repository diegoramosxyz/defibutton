Traditional Finance and Decentralized Finance are not compatible technologies. For this reason people need to move their money between these paradigms for different purposes. You may not yet be able to buy a car with cryptocurrency, but you can send money across the planet in less than a minute. Eventually people will accept cryptocurrencies and see them as a good medium of exchange.

To enjoy all the benefits of DeFi you must move your money from your bank account to a cryptocurrency wallet.

## On buying cryptocurrencies

You currently own your wealth in FIAT currency. FIAT is the currency that your local government issues, such as, the US Dollar and the Euro. To move that wealth into DeFi you can do one of two things:

1. **From Bank Account to Centralized Exchange to Crypto Wallet**

This is the most common route. You deposit your FIAT/CASH into a centralized exchange which holds your cryptocurrencies for you. Coinbase and Binance are two of the most popular centralized crypto exchanges in the world. By using one of these services you are putting all your trust on this entity and you don't really "own" your crypto. To own your crypto you must own your private keys.

### Private keys

Put simply, a private key is the ultimate key to your money. It can be represented as an ordered list of words which people can write down on a piece of paper. These words, also known as mnemonics or seed phrase must be protected at all costs!

With this in mind, we should consider centralized exchanges as a mere bridge between the old financial system and DeFi.

Example:

1. Frank has 3000 USD in his bank account
2. Frank deposits 1000 USD into Binance
3. Frank buys 1000 USD worth of ETH (Ethereum) in Binance
4. Frank sends 100% of his ETH from Binance into [MetaMask](/blog/metamask)

You would not have to go through this hoops if you were paid in cryptocurrency instead of FIAT.

2. **Peer-to-Peer Transfer**

In this case you ask a friend or acquaintance to transfer cryptocurrency into your crypto wallet in exchange for FIAT currency.

Example:

1. John has 5000 COIN
2. $COIN is currently worth $1.00 USD
3. Tyrone has 2000 USD
4. John sends Tyrone 2000 COIN in exchange for 2000 USD
