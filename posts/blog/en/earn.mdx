There are many ways to earn with cryptocurrencies. The amount that you earn is directly proportional to the level of risk that you are willing to take on.

## Low risk strategies

- Hold

You can earn from your crypto assets by simply having them. If you have ETH and you think its price will increase you can simply wait for a good price to sell. This can become a years long strategy as you wait for the price to go up.

- Lending

You can use liquidity protocols, such as [AAVE](/coin/aave) and [Compound](/coin/compound), to earn passive income by locking your assets in a smart contract. You earn interest on your deposit, which is paid by those who borrow from the protocol.
