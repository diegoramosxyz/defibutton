There are many ways to earn with cryptocurrencies. The amount that you earn is directly proportional to the level of risk that you are willing to take on.

## Lending

You can use money market protocols, such as [AAVE](/projects/aave) and [Compound](/projects/compound), to earn passive income by locking your assets in a smart contract. You earn interest on your deposit, which is paid by those who borrow from the protocol.
