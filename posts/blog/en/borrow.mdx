  title: "Borrow"

In DeFi we have liquidity provider protocols such as a [AAVE](/projects/aave) and [Compound](/projects/compound) where you can take overcollateralized loans to generate leverage.

You deposit any supported asset as collateral and borrow another asset to gain exposure to another asset without reducing your exposure to your collateral. In other words, you deposit cryptocurrency in a smart contract in order to borrow another cryptocurrency. If everything goes well you will be able to pay back the loan with interest and keep both your collateral and the profits.

Learn more about this strategy in [the AAVE page](/projects/aave).
