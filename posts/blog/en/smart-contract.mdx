A smart contract is a self-executing agreement that runs in a blockchain. They work just like a vending machine. If you deposit `x` amount of coins you get product `A`. Smart contracts are the foundation of decentralized finance. They are used to automate financial services and can be combined as if they were _"money legos"_ to make even more powerful financial services.

Here is a short list of awesome financial tools built using smart contracts:

- [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/): A decentralized trading protocol
- [DAI](https://makerdao.com/): A decentralized stable coin
- [AAVE](https://aave.com/): A decentralized lending and borrowing platform

## Smart contract vs old contracts

Let's say that Pablo wants to exchange BLUE coins for RED coins with Bob, remotely.

### Old contract

In the old world Pablo and Bob have to trust a third party who will confirm that Pablo and Bob have deposited their corresponding amount of coins and then make the exchange happen. This transaction requires that Pablo and Bob place their trust in this centralized institution. Even worse, the exchange will probably take a few days to complete and cost a high fee.

### Smart contract

With a smart contract Pablo and Bob would deposit their corresponding coins and in a matter of seconds the contract will automatically make the exchange. Pablo and Bob only need to trust the code and pay a small fee to the network for having the contract be executed. If any of the parties fail to fulfill their duty, the contract will **not** execute. Neither party can cheat.

## Real World Data

Smart contracts must rely on oracles to take real world data into account when executing a contract.

## Bugs

Smart contracts are programmed by humans, and humans make mistakes. The human errors in the source code for smart contracts are called _bugs_. When a bug is encountered it can have terrible consequences for the users. The bug can cause funds on the smart contract to be destroyed, locked forever or stolen by a malicious actor. For this reason smart contracts are audited by security experts before they are released.
