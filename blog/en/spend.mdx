Spending your cryptocurrencies is not as easy as it should be yet. Decentralized finance is a new technology and people are just starting to adopt it. It will take years, but ideally you will be able to transact your crypto cheaply and fast without having to first convert your money into FIAT currency. This will totally depend on the willingness of people to accept cryptocurrencies as a medium exchange.
