Banks take your money, your privacy and the control over your finances. They profit from your money and they do not even guarantee that you will receive your money back when you want it. You can read about bank failures [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_failure).

To take back your money, your privacy and control over your finances you need decentralized finance.

## Costly

Banks may ask you to have a minimum balance in your account or make regular deposits just so you are not charged a fee. And even if your bank account had no fees you are paying by providing the bank with money, which they use to profit, giving you little or no portion of that profit.

## No Privacy

If you use credit or debit cards to buy things then your bank knows and stores **when, where and what** you buy. These private and for-profit entities have sensitive information about you that is susceptible to data breaches.

## No Control

You have no control over your money. At any given time the bank can deny you access to your money due to economic collapse, system errors or any other reason. You are at the mercy of your bank keeping their promise to give you your money back when you want it.

## Slow

Transactions with banks can take days or even weeks to clear. It may also be inconvenient if the working ours of your bank are not ideal for you.
