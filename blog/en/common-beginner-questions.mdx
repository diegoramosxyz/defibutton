## What is decentralized finance (DeFi)?

First, in this context decentralization refers to a network of computers distributed around the world that work together to run computer code.

Decentralized Finance is a concept that refers to a collection of decentralized financial services, also called protocols, that when combined can replace the current centralized financial system. This includes banking, lending, borrowing, trading, exchanging and much more. There is no entity who determines what forms part of DeFi. The nature of this space allows anyone to create a financial service, and people are free to determine which protocols to use to fulfill their financial needs.

Bitcoin is part of DeFi because it is a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system.

## Why should I care about DeFi?

You should care about decentralized finance (DeFi) because it gives you absolute control over your finances. After the invention of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, DeFi became the logical next step towards a better financial system. One that is open to every internet user in the world, has no "CEO" or "president", has no intermediaries, requires no permission to be used and cannot be censored.

DeFi will not magically solve all your financial problems, but it will give you the choice to solve them on your own terms.

## This sounds too good to be true, it must be a scam!

DeFi is not a scam, in fact it is much easier to trust than anything we have had in finance before. DeFi is open source code that runs on computers. This means that unlike the centralized financial system, DeFi can be scrutinized by anyone in the world. If you only use DeFi protocols that have been audited by security experts and have high volume of transactions, it is unlikely that you will have unexpected outcomes. Computers can't cheat or steal or be negligent. Computers only do what they are programmed to do.

## What if Bitcoin gets hacked?

Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has never been hacked. It is exceptionally difficult to do because it requires an immense amount of computing power. The hackers would need access to at least 51% of all the computers that mine Bitcoin in the entire planet.

## Is Bitcoin just a bubble?

Humans have speculated over the value of assets for hundreds of years. You can make an argument that speculation is damaging, but it is an intrinsic byproduct of free markets. If Bitcoin fits the criteria of speculative bubble it is only because of people. The true value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lies in their capability to create a decentralized financial system. Wether 1 Bitcoin is worth $1 USD or $1,000,000 USD is up for people to decide.

## Is Bitcoin anonymous?

No. The network itself does not contain any personal information, but if your identity can be linked to a Bitcoin address then, every single transaction to you make will be known and publicly available. This also applies to the Ethereum blockchain.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain with smart contract functionality. Smart contracts are the foundation of DeFi, they allow for the creation automated financial services which remove the need for intermediaries. The Bitcoin blockchain does not support smart contracts, which greatly limits its usefulness when compared to Ethereum.

The Ethereum network has a native currency called Ether (ETH), used to pay for transactions.
