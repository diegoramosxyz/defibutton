Finance is about trust. You have to trust your bank and your government issued currency. In centralized finance the trust is ultimately put on humans. Even when everything is automated with credit cards and mobile payments, humans can get involved at any step of the process.

Banks are centralized and for profit institutions run by individuals who make mistakes, may be incompetent, have malicious intentions or simply not care about you as a client.

We now have the option to trust computers instead of humans.

## Can the code be trusted?

Computers are programmed using code. These are instructions telling a computer **exactly** what to do. A computer does **not** make decisions by itself. A computer can't even make mistakes! Humans are the ones who make mistakes by not programming the computer correctly. And you may ask: "But if everything a computer does is programmed by humans, how is that any better than banks?"

When people write code for cryptocurrencies and DeFi protocols they make all their work public, known as [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) code. They must do this because humans cannot be trusted. All the trust is placed on the code. There are expert programmers and engineers whose work is to review code aiming to eliminate human errors.

Ideally, you would read the code to understand exactly what you are using, but 99% of people will never do this. If you are not an expert you should only use protocols that have been audited by security experts.

## What if the programmers change the code?

Ethereum smart contracts are immutable, in other words, once they are deployed they cannot be modified.

Developers usually use governance for their protocols. This means that whenever they want to make a change they must have the approval of the users who vote to approve or reject changes. If a change is approved, the developers deploy new smart contracts containing the changes. The old smart contracts will remain forever in the Ethereum blockchain, but developers will likely discourage their use.

## Conclusion

You should not trust banks with your money. You can trust the code because it is transparent. There are **no secrets**. We all agree on and play by the same rules.
