## Can I recover my wallet/money if I lost my secret words?

No. You cannot recover your coins if you lost your secret words.

## Why can't I buy BTC using Uniswap or SushiSwap?

Uniswap and SushiSwap are Ethereum DEXES. You cannot transact ETH for BTC directly because they live in different blockchains. You have the option of buying Ethereum tokens which track the price of BTC. Wrapped BTC ([WBTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin)) and [renBTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/renbtc) are two good options.
