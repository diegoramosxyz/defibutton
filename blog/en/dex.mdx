Decentralized exchanges are DeFi protocols to exchange cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. These protocols are made with Smart Contracts and contain algorithmns that generate liquidity for buyers and sellers.

To perform a transaction in a decentralized exchange such as SushiSwap or Uniswap, you go to the official websites for such protocol and using their graphical user interface connect your crypto wallet. Once your wallet is connected you can select one of the currencies you hold and exchange it for another one.

Unfortunately these transactions can become quite expensive when there is increased volume in the network. This problem will be resolved with the introduction of Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions.
