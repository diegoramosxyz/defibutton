## On buying cryptocurrencies

The following are temporary, but necessary steps to take in order to own cryptocurrencies.

You currently own your wealth in FIAT (Cash). To move that wealth into crypto you will do one of two things:

1. **Bank Account > Centralized Exchange > Crypto Wallet**

This is the most common option. What you do is deposit your FIAT/CASH into a centralized exchange which holds your cryptocurrencies for you. You are putting all your trust into this entity and you don't really "own" your crypto.

To be part of the real DeFi ecosystem you must transfer your crypto from this centralized exchange to a crypto wallet. Only when you hold your coins in a crypto wallet you can enjoy all the benefits of DeFi.

Example:

1. Frank has 3000 USD in his bank account
2. Frank deposits 1000 USD into Binance
3. Frank buys 1000 USD worth of ETH (Ethereum) in Binance
4. Frank sends 100% of his ETH from Binance into MetaMask

All of this is necessary because you get paid in FIAT currency.

> If you intend to trade crypto it is recommended to use a centralized exchange
> because you will avoid paying network fees. Developers in all blockchains are
> working to lowers these costs.

2. **Peer to Peer Transfer**

In this case you are asking a real person, either online or offline, to transfer cryptocurrency into your crypto wallet in exchange for FIAT currency.

Example:

1. John has 5000 COIN
2. $COIN is currently worth $1.00 USD
3. Tyrone has 2000 USD
4. John sends Tyrone 2000 COIN in exchange for 2000 USD
