## Address

A string that represents a human owned account or a smart contract, used to send and receive cryptocurrency.

## APY

Annual percentage yield represents the rate of return for your interest accrued. Unlike annual percentage rate (APR) used in traditional finance, APY stresses the idea of compound interest that you are earning in DeFi.

## Audit

A thorough security review of the code of smart contracts made by security experts and engineers to determine the risks of failure and vulnerabilities in the code. All DeFi projects should have their smart contracts audited before release by a third-party because a bug can cause catastrophic and irreversible damage.

## Automated Market Maker (AMM)

An automated market maker is a smart contract that creates liquidity pools of specific ERC20 tokens which are traded algorithmically rather than individual trading. Liquidity providers (LP) earn fees based on their liquidity provisions in creating market efficiency.

## Cold Wallets

A crypto wallet, usually a hardware wallet, used to store crypto assets for long periods of time.

## Collateralization

Borrowing a digital asset to gain exposure on other assets.

## Cryptocurrency

Algorithmic based digital currencies that live on the blockchain and available to send and receive.

## DAO

Decentralized autonomous organization. Full control of the platform lies in the hands of the governance token holders.

## dApp

The user interface that interacts with the web3 smart contracts. Decentralized application that enables users to easily use the underlying protocol(s).

## DeFi

Decentralized Finance is a series of Smart Contracts on the blockchain that hosts financial primitives in a non-custodial manner. It is a global, censorship-resistant and open financial system with no intermediaries.

## Derivative

Investment figure based off of an underlying value.

## DEX

A decentralized exchange that uses smart contracts and algorithms to enable users to exchange cryptocurrencies without intermediaries.

## Digital Signature

Confirmation of a transaction on the blockchain.

## Distributed Ledger

Shared consensus of data across the blockchain network. There is no central administrator that controls the data and transactions.

## ERC-20

Token standard built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

## ERC721

Non-fungible tokens. Usually in the form of a collectible on the blockchain like art or cards.

## Ethereum

Ethereum is the blockchain that Smart Contracts and DeFi run on. The native currency is ETH or ETHER.

## ETH

The native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, used to pay transaction fees.

## EVM

Blockchain-based software program that allows developers to interact with the Ethereum network.

## FIAT

Government issued currency like the US dollar.

## Gas Fees

Rewards paid to validators that confirm each transaction on the blockchain. Paid in ETH.

## Governance (and Token)

Token issued by projects used to grow the platform through voting power.

## GWEI

Unit that measures the value of gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Hot Wallets

Wallets that are used for daily purposes. Examples include: exchanges, mobile wallets, and desktop wallets.

## Impermanent Loss

When providing liquidity to markets that are still not efficient, liquidity providers may not receive their initial equivalent value upon withdraw due to volatility across token prices and arbitragers.

## IOU Token

Token that represents your share in the pool.

## Lending Aggregator

Algorithmic based system that maximizes your yield across lending protocols.

## Liquidation

When trading on leverage, you supply the collateral to support your borrowed position. If the price of the asset at hand falls below the price determined by your collateralization ratio, then your position is liquidated. This means that someone bought you out of your position and most likely took a fee depending on the platform.

## Liquidity Providing

Providing liquidity to protocols to create more market efficiency. Liquidity providers are rewarded for their through fees.

## Mainnet

The official deployed version of the live blockchain that developers can interact with.

## mStable

mStable brings together stablecoins with high yield earning strategies.

## Multisig Wallet

One of the most secure wallets you can create. Requires at least two keys to sign off on a transaction.

## Node

Computer connected to the blockchain that follows rules and shares information with other computers on the network.

## Optimize

Autonomously searching for the highest ROI.

## Private Key

Lock and key scenario for your wallet. Private key is your secure password that needs to be kept in a safe location and not shared with anyone.

## Protocol

Suite of smart contracts that allow users to interact with the application.

## Public Key

A public address that can be shared and used to receive cryptocurrency.

## Rebalance

The process of algorithmically finding the best yield for users through constant adjustments of the allocation.

## Relayer

Products that provide direct access to an underlying protocol.

## Robo-Advisor

Algorithmic based system that actively returns the highest net value profit.

## ROI

Return on Investment.

## Scalability

The capacity for a blockchain to withstand increases in volume without increasing transaction fees.

## Smart Contract

A smart contract is code on the Ethereum blockchain that controls the exchange of value in a trustless manner.

## Solidity

The programming language that is used to write Smart Contracts in the Ethereum blockchain.

## Stablecoin

1:1 USD equivalent in digital form on the blockchain. Some maintain a $1 US peg, while some suffer from volatility like DAI.

## Transaction Block

Basket of data that flows through the blockchain.

## TVL

TVL stands for "total value locked" within a protocol; the amount of assets a protocol has.

## yEarn

Suite of DeFi tools using smart contracts to provide financial independence to users.

## 51% Attack

Single entity or organization taking control of the blockchain voting power through their monopoly of mining power.
