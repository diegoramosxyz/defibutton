When you enter decentralized finance you accept the responsibility of keeping your money safe. Here are some tips on how to stay safe in this environment.

### Bookmark everything

Scammers create copies of popular dapps to take advantage of naive users. To avoid falling into this traps use Twitter and CoinGecko. If you heard about [SushiSwap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sushi) and would like to try it out, **DON'T USE GOOGLE**. Instead go to [coingecko.com](https://coingecko.com/) and search for the token, SUSHI in this case. CoinGecko has reliable links about DeFi projects.

If the dapp you want to use doesn't have token, go to their official twitter page and click the link in their profile. [Zerion](https://twitter.com/zerion_io) is an example.

Once you are completely certain that you are in the correct website, bookmark such website. Press `Ctrl + d` or `Cmd + d` for MacOS. Whenever you want to use any dapp again, only use your bookmarks.

### Only use audited DeFi projects

Anyone can create Ethereum Smart Contracts. You must not trust unaidited smart contracts, not just because the developer may have malicious intentions, but also because the smart contracts are usually complex and prone to bugs. If you discovered a new DeFi protocol look for a security audit report on their website.

### Never share your secret words

Anyone with access to your secret words has absolute control over your crypto wallet. Secret words are like the code that opens a safe. Never share this information.
