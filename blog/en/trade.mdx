If you are experienced with financial tools you can trade cryptocurrency to profit from volatility.

## Buy low, sell high

Regardless of the potential for growth of a cryptocurrency you can trade it over a short period of time and profit from high volatility.

## Options

Options are a more complicated financial tool that allows you to profit under any circumstance in the market. These are much riskier than trading the underlying asset, but with more risk there is more potential for profit. Options can be used to trade on bullish markets, consolidating markets and bearish markets.
