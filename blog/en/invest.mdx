Just like in traditional finance, you can invest using decentralized finance. If you believe, for example, that Ethereum is a valuable asset because of its popularity and potential, then you can invest in Ethereum by buying Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency for the Ethereum Blockchain.

There are some strategies used in traditional finance that apply to DeFi.

## Dollar Cost Averaging

Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile assets. It would be quite difficult to know when it is a good time to buy a coin. The Dollar Cost Averaging strategy consists in splitting your purchase amount to buy periodically a set amount of an asset, regardless of the price. The expectation is that you will buy more of the target asset and a low price, than if you made a single purchase.

Example: Pablo wants to buy $300 USD worth of ETH. Pablo splits his budget into 3 to buy $100 worth of ETH every week.

| Week | ETH Price | Purchase amount (USD) | ETH bought |
| ---- | --------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| 1    | $10       | $100                  | 10         |
| 2    | $11       | $100                  | 9.09       |
| 3    | $8        | $100                  | 12.5       |

If Pablo had bought $300 USD worth of ETH he would only have 30 ETH, but since he split up his budget into three purchases he was able to buy 10 ETH on week one, 9.09 ETH on week two and 12.5 ETH on week three, for a total of 31.59 ETH. Pablo gained 1.59 ETH by using this strategy!
