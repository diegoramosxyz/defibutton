Just like in traditional finance, you can invest using decentralized finance. If you believe, for example, that Ethereum is a valuable asset because of its popularity and potential, then you can invest in Ethereum by buying Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency for the Ethereum Blockchain.

DeFi is rapidly evolving and there is so much innovation happening that it can become overlwheming. You must do your research into whatever DeFi project catches your attention. You can use these pointers to determine whether or not to learn more and invest in a project:

- Does the project project solve a big problem?

Bitcoin removes the need for intermediaries on peer-to-peer transactions over the internet. Ethereum has turing complete smart contracts that can be used to create any financial service that exist today and even new ones that were not possible before.

These projects provide solutions to big problems. There is no garantee that they will succeed, but it is a good sign the they will grow.

- Is the project a decentralized replacement for an important service in traditional finance?

Uniswap lets you exchange cryptocurrencies in a decentralized and intermediary free fashion, which is a direct replacement for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

You can see the potential of a project by recognizing what it aims to replace and how much that is worth.

- Are the developers anonymous?

Reputation is irrelevant in DeFi because humans can't be trusted. A DeFi protocol can work perfectly fine with anonymous developers because when the code is open source there can be no secrets. The developers can't hide how their protocol works and what permissions they have.

The identity of the creator of Bitcoin is still a mistery, and yet it is currently the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap.

When you are doing your research into a project it can be good to know if an important developer is working on it, but ultimately, what matters is the code.

- Does the project have security audits?

All DeFi projects are suceptible to human error. These errors are called bugs and they can cause a protocol to be exploited or have unexpected outcomes. Security audits aim to search for any posibility of failure in the code of the project, and mitigate it. These audits do not garantee the complete safety of a protocol against bugs, but it is reckless not to have them on a DeFi project when there can be so much at risk.

# Investing

There are some strategies used in traditional finance that apply to DeFi.

## Dollar Cost Averaging

Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile assets. It would be quite difficult to know when it is a good time to buy a coin. The Dollar Cost Averaging strategy consists in splitting your purchase amount to buy periodically a set amount of an asset, regardless of the price. The expectation is that you will buy more of the target asset and a low price, than if you made a single purchase.

Example: Pablo wants to buy $300 USD worth of ETH. Pablo splits his budget into 3 to buy $100 worth of ETH every week.

| Week | ETH Price | Purchase amount (USD) | ETH bought |
| ---- | --------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| 1    | $10       | $100                  | 10         |
| 2    | $11       | $100                  | 9.09       |
| 3    | $8        | $100                  | 12.5       |

If Pablo had bought $300 USD worth of ETH he would only have 30 ETH, but since he split up his budget into three purchases he was able to buy 10 ETH on week one, 9.09 ETH on week two and 12.5 ETH on week three, for a total of 31.59 ETH. Pablo gained 1.59 ETH by using this strategy!

Over short periods of time this strategy can produce lower returns, but the longer it is used, the more effective it becomes.
