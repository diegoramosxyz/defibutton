# DeFi Button

DeFi Button aims to be a free source of educational content about decentralized finance.

Internationalization is a key part of this project. We don't want language to be a hurdle for people to learn.

On the technical side, DeFi Button focuses on delivering a fast and mobile friendly interface. It prioritizes performance on low cost smartphones with poor internet connections, which is achieved by following Google's Lighthouse recommendations and reducing the use of JavaScript on the front-end.

DeFi Button is also available as a progressive web app (PWA).

A transition from React.js to Svelte is planned once Svelte Kit reaches v1.
