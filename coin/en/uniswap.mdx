Uniswap (UNI) is the governance token for the Uniswap decentralized exchange. It was built on Ethereum and it utilizes an Automated Market Maker (AMM) to provide liquidity. In simpler terms, it is a protocol that allows for permissionless and intermediary free cryptocurrency swaps. Just as you can exchange dollars for euros in centralized finance, you can exchange different cryptocurrencies using Uniswap, but in a decentralized manner.

This is a video showcasing how a transaction is performed in the Uniswap protocol:
